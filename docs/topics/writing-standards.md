# Writing Standards

## Format

Each of the Topics will include a set of Standards. With each Standard being defined using the following template:

```text
<Title> (<Reference ID>)

<Description>

Rationale:
  - ...
  - ...

Alternatives:
  - ...
  - ...

Exceptions:
  - ...
  - ...
```

### Title

A short and descriptive title to refer to the standard in conversation

### Reference ID

An ID to use for referencing the standard in other documentation or automation.

### Description

A clear, concise, specific and actionable description of the standard. Each standard *must* contain words that clearly direct decision making. Use words such as *shall, must, always and never.

- This ID should *never* be changed once the standard has been set. If the standard is no longer relevant or if the contents has changed significantly, the old standard should be retired and replaced with a new standard and new ID.
- Format:
    - &lt;Two Letter Abbreviation>-&lt;Numerical Code>
    - The abbreviation should be reflective of the area the standard is part of.
    - The code is a 3-digit number starting from 100.

### Alternatives

One or more bullets suggesting alternatives for standards that prohibit some choice

### Rationale

One or more bullets describing the reason the standard exists
