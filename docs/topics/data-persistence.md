## (DP-200) Approved Database Engines

Only the following database engines are approved for project in Labs:

Engine       | Permitted Versions | Providers
------------ | ------------------ | ------------
Postgres     | > 11.5.0           | AWS RDS
             |                    | Heroku Postgres
SQLite       | None               | None
Oracle       | None               | None
MySQL        | None               | None
DB2          | None               | None

Rationale:

- We restrict the database engine use in Lambda Labs so that we can focus our resources on a subset of available technologies. By narrowing the field of choices, we feel that product quality will be improved through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

Exceptions:

- None
