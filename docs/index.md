# Labs Engineering Standards

## Overview

This document describes the engineering standards that teams working in Lambda X must comply with. Adherence to these standards are critical to the continued success of the Lambda X organization, as they allow us to more effectively manage the scores of teams working across hundreds of products.

## Topics

This guide is divided into separate topics, saved here in Notion as pages. A topic corresponds to a specific area of concern in software engineering:

- [Developer Workflow](topics/developer-workflow.md)
- [Data Persistence](topics/data-persistence.md)
- [Programming Languages](topics/programming-languages.md)
- [Git](topics/git.md)
- [Code Quality](topics/code-quality.md)
- [Security](topics/security.md)

## Process

These standards will morph over time as we adapt to the ever-changing technology landscape. In addition, the stardards will embrace a subset of all of the available technologies, so that teams have options when making technical decisions. To in order to ensure that these documents are inclusive of the needs of all Labs groups, each new standard or change to an existing standard will be ratified by approval from 3 Labs Tech Leads.
